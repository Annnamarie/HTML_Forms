# Activity 6: Working with HTML Forms 📝

## Overview ℹ️
Worked with HTML forms to enhance interactivity on your website. You'll learn how to create forms, style them using CSS, and respond to user input using JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives 🧠
- Created an HTML form
- Styled an HTML form using CSS rules
- Responded to a submit event based on user input using JavaScript

## Getting Started 🧑‍🏫
### Step 1: Create a Form
- Added a `<form>` element to your HTML file
- Added `<input>` elements for user input fields
- Used `<label>` elements to describe each input field

### Step 2: Style the Form
- Used CSS to style the form elements
- Set `display: block;` for the input elements to stack them vertically
- Used margins to create space between elements

### Step 3: Respond to User Input
- Created a JavaScript function to handle form submission
- Used `document.getElementById()` to get input values
- Used `console.log()` to print input values to the console
- Used `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the default form submission behavior

## Optional Stretch Challenges 🏋️
- Display a list of song requests
- Allow the user to submit a request multiple times using a passphrase
- Customize your form with additional input types and CSS styling
